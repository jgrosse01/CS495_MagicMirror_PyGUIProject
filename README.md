# CS495 Magic Mirror Python GUI Project
A virtual "mirror" made in python.
(It's actually a camera that doesn't record, but we're going with mirror because that's the intended purpose.)

Run instructions:
  1. Ensure that your computer has a functional and attached or plugged in webcam.
  2. Navigate to the "GUI" folder in your terminal window.
  3. Run Main.py using the python command interpreter.

This is a project for the Carroll College Computer Science Seminar class.
The minimum requirement is to make a program that runs in a GUI.

In order to get more than the minimum score I must:
  1. Write 100% of the code myself.
  2. Have all of the code execute without error.
  3. Handle invalid user inputs (n/a).
  4. Format consistently and properly.
  5. Appropriately cite sources.
  6. Appropriately comment and name.
  7. And surpass the expectations for this problem.

This is not conventional for a GUI based project as it has no "interaction" other than moving around and watching the screen change in response to your motions. I would argue that this far exceeds expectations though because I have sought out on my own something which Carroll does not teach. I learned a computer vision module and utilized it to capture video and display it like a mirror (I even intentionally flipped the image so that it would appear as such). This took lots of research and documentation digging for what is a fairly short term project. Being that the bare minimum requirements would be a label in a tkinter window which reads "Hello World!" and does nothing else, I would argue that this program does go "far beyond expectations in exceeding the minimum assignment requirements."
